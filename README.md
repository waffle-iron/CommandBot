# TriniroBot
TrinitoBot is a branch of iArePJ's CommandBot used for the discord server Unlimited Force HQ. (https://discord.gg/XYR2Jm5)
(Note that you need nodejs to run this.)

# Running TrinitroBot:
Open run.js with notepad or your preferred text editor and add your Bot's Token.  
Open Start.bat and you should be good to go!

# Usage:
Type "~help" if you forget how to create commands.  
Type "~commands" for a list of commands you have made.

Creating commands is really easy. Open up commands.txt and type in the command you want to create.
Example:  
~dog; (You use semicolons to seperate commands like this: ~dog;~cat;)

Once you do that, you create a .txt file in the commands folder with the name of the command. (In our instance, we call it ~dog.txt)
Add whatever you want in the file. I'll put in a URL to an image of a dog.
Save it and type in the command in chat. The bot will respond with the message you put in.

Example:
You: ~dog
TrinitroBot: https://i.imgur.com/tjvD7lA.jpg

You can have multiple random responses by adding a semi-colon to seperate them. You don't need a semi-colon for the last one.

Example:  
Hey;Hello;What's up;Howdy

This will make it output Hey, Hello, or What's up randomly.  
The responses must be inside the brackets and must be seperated by semi-colons. No semi-colon is needed for the last response.
